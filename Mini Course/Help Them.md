## **How to Help Them Make Their Own Path**

### 1. **Start with Their Goal**

- Ask them to define their personal “why”:
    
    - Do they want to get hired?
        
    - Build their own product?
        
    - Freelance? Teach?
        
- Emphasize that every path looks different — no one-size-fits-all.
    

### 2. **Map Their Current Skills**

- Help them honestly assess where they are now:
    
    - Basics of HTML/CSS/JS — check.
        
    - What about Git, debugging, frameworks?
        
- Identify gaps that matter _most_ for their goal.
    

### 3. **Build a Step-by-Step Roadmap**

- Small, manageable milestones tailored to their needs.
    
- Example: “Learn React basics → Build portfolio project → Learn Git → Apply for junior jobs.”
    
- Show them how to avoid overwhelm by focusing on one chunk at a time.
    

### 4. **Support & Accountability**

- Offer yourself as the guide who can:
    
    - Answer questions and unblock them.
        
    - Review their code and give feedback.
        
    - Help adjust the plan if life or interests change.
        

### 5. **Celebrate Progress & Adapt**

- Teach them to regularly review progress.
    
- Adjust learning plans to keep motivation high and goals realistic.
