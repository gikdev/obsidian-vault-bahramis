## **TL;DR Strategy**

1. Clarify **goal + time + energy**
2. Pick **high-leverage skills** first (React + TS + routing + state + backend basics)
3. Build **real apps**, learn by doing
4. Breadth = glance & use as needed
5. Depth = core skills that let you ship apps confidently
6. Timebox, prioritize, ignore distractions
